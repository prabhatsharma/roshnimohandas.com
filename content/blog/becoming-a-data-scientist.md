Hello, World! Here I am, finally fulfilling my desire to become a blogger, particularly in the field of ML & Deep Learning. Fittingly, it is the eve of the new year. Some timing to start with this blog, isn’t it?

With the advances in the field of Artificial Intelligence, there is a question that keeps popping up time and again from my colleagues and students, “How do I become a Data Scientist?”. It is, in fact, according to numerous reports, one of the most in demand jobs in the world right now.

This provides food for thought though, as to what are the qualifications that are needed to work as a Data Scientist in a top MNC? Most of the companies in the I.T. sector, especially those aspiring to become powerhouses in the fields of AI, would require you to either have a Master’s degree in the field of Analytics, or preferably, a PhD in one of Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics and so on. One can specialize in one or many of the below topics based on one’s liking

1. Structured Data Analysis
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
1. Computer Vision (CV)
1. Optimization
1. Bayesian networks
1. Deep learning

In addition to specializing in one of the above domains, you also have the option to choose the field in which you want to utilize your skills as a Data Scientist. Here are a few:

1. Retail
1. Finance
1. Telecom
1. Manufacturing
1. Healthcare

There are, of course, many other areas to add to this list, but these are the most lucrative ones.

Becoming a Data Scientist means you need to have a wealth of knowledge in the field of Data Analytics accompanied by a strong hand in coding and understanding complex mathematical problems. To sum it up, here are a few must haves before you decide to take that next step in your career:

Programming skills: Python/R (Knowledge of C++ is essential)
Basic Mathematics like Calculus, Linear Algebra, Vectors and Matrices
Machine Learning fundamentals
Statistics and Probability Theory
Any visualization tools will be an added advantage. Eg. Tableau
Now that you have an idea about what are the key skills that are needed to become a Data Scientist, let’s have a look at some of other ways that might help working people to upskill, without quitting their jobs:

1. Certifications from reputed online educational websites like Coursera, edx.org, Udacity (They have a range of Nanodegree programs), Udemy, etc.
1. Take up case studies in Kaggle.
1. Create an online presence. Follow prominent figures in the field of AI on twitter and look up the latest trends, white papers and publications.
1. Channel your thoughts into writing papers, blogs, etc.
1. Have a github repository to publish your code , case studies you worked on etc. Some companies will ask you for the same
1. Start solving coding problems on Leetcode or on Hacker-Rank. My personal preference is Leetcode.

Finally , here are a few pointers to help find a job in your dream company:

1. Get a reference through your contacts, get that interview and crack it. (Of course, prepare well in advance)
1. Apply for jobs through LinkedIn.
1. Participate in hackathons which offer jobs.
1. Maintain a Github repository with the codes and case studies that you worked on.
1. Try to get an internship in a good company, work hard and get absorbed into the same.
1. If you have previous job experience, try to move into the Analytics team of your company. Getting a break as a fresher in a new company might be difficult and the pay scale would also not be that high.
1. Join a startup.

One thing that you need to keep in mind is that unlike Software Engineering, Data Science is iterative in nature, and you don’t get the best results from day one. My advice, don’t lose patience, be at it, till you make it. You should also be able to measure any errors that you encounter in the solutions you build using various methods, such as accuracy, precision, recall, ROC Curves, etc. These methods will vary from model to model.

Another important thing to know is that ML is garbage in, garbage out, so the size and quality of the data (Test/Training) you use, is important. Make sure that you spend a good amount of time on obtaining the correct data. An extremely crucial step in building solutions with the help of ML is Data Preprocessing. This is another necessary evil every Data Scientist should be familiar with. Only with experience, and most importantly failures, will you learn.

Last, but not the least, a useful pointer: A lot of Deep Learning models are Black-Box models, which means that they will give good predictions, but will not provide any insight as to how the result was calculated. So you need to select the right model based on the solution that you are working on.

Achieving all of the above will take you at-least a year (Assuming that you study for 6–7 hrs./day and have no prior knowledge in the field of AI).

A Data scientist should also be curious about the “Why?” factor to every problem/solution. And he/she needs to have a hunger to study about new technologies, and learn throughout their career.

I teach ML & Deep Learning concepts in a few institutions. Feel free to contact me for weekend classes on any/all of the above topics.

Happy New Year 2019 to all. Happy learning and hope to see you become a Data Scientist soon!
